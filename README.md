[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Galeria-Kaufhof/pillar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Galeria-Kaufhof/pillar)

Pillar manages migrations for your [Cassandra][cassandra] data stores.

[cassandra]:http://cassandra.apache.org

Pillar grew from a desire to automatically manage Cassandra schema as code. Managing schema as code enables automated
build and deployment, a foundational practice for an organization striving to achieve [Continuous Delivery][cd].

Pillar is to Cassandra what [Rails ActiveRecord][ar] migrations or [Play Evolutions][evolutions] are to relational
databases with one key difference: Pillar is completely independent from any application development framework.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Java 8 runtime environment
1. Cassandra 2.0 with the native CQL protocol enabled

### From Source

This method requires [Simple Build Tool (sbt)][sbt].
Building an RPM can be done via sbt-native-packager.

    % sbt assembly   # builds just the jar file in the target directory

    % sbt rpm:packageBin # builds the RPM in the target directory
    % sudo rpm -i target/pillar-<version>.noarch.rpm

The RPM installs Pillar to /opt/pillar.

[sbt]:http://www.scala-sbt.org
[sbt-native-packager]:http://sbt-native-packager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

### Packages

Pillar is available at Maven Central under the GroupId com.datastax and ArtifactId pillar_2.10, pillar_2.11 or
pillar_2.12. The current version of pillar is 5.0.0.

#### sbt

libraryDependencies += "com.datastax" %% "pillar" % "5.0.0"

#### Gradle

compile 'com.datastax:pillar_2.11:5.0.0'

## Usage

### Terminology

Data Store
: A logical grouping of environments. You will likely have one data store per application.

Environment
: A context or grouping of settings for a single data store. You will likely have at least development and production
environments for each data store.

Migration
: A single change to a data store. Migrations have a description and a time stamp indicating the time at which it was
authored. Migrations are applied in ascending order and reversed in descending order.

### Command Line

#####Here's the short version:

Given the configuration:

```
pillar.my_keyspace {
  prod {
     ...
  }
  development {
       ...
    }
}
```
  1. Write migrations, place them in conf/pillar/migrations/myapp.
  1. Add pillar settings to conf/application.conf.
  1. `% pillar initialize -e prod my_keyspace`
  1. `% pillar migrate -e prod my_keyspace`

*Note: development is the default environment if nothing is specified*

Or we could compile and run the jar:

```
java -cp "slf4j-simple.jar:pillar-assembly.jar" de.kaufhof.pillar.cli.App -d "path/to/migrations" -e "prod" initialize "my_keyspace"
```

#### Migration Files

Migration files contain metadata about the migration, a [CQL][cql] statement used to apply the migration and,
optionally, a [CQL][cql] statement used to reverse the migration. Each file describes one migration. You probably
want to name your files according to time stamp and description, 1370028263_creates_views_table.cql, for example.
Pillar reads and parses all files in the migrations directory, regardless of file name.

[cql]:http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql3/CQL.html

Pillar supports reversible, irreversible and reversible with a no-op down statement migrations. Here are examples of
each:

Reversible migrations have up and down properties.

    -- description: creates views table
    -- authoredAt: 1370028263
    -- up:

    CREATE TABLE views (
      id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
      url text,
      person_id int,
      viewed_at timestamp
    )

    -- down:

    DROP TABLE views

Irreversible migrations have an up property but no down property.

    -- description: creates events table
    -- authoredAt: 1370023262
    -- up:

    CREATE TABLE events (
      batch_id text,
      occurred_at uuid,
      event_type text,
      payload blob,
      PRIMARY KEY (batch_id, occurred_at, event_type)
    )

Reversible migrations with no-op down statements have an up property and an empty down property.

    -- description: adds user_agent to views table
    -- authoredAt: 1370028264
    -- up:

    ALTER TABLE views
    ADD user_agent text

    -- down:

Each migration may optionally specify multiple stages. Stages are executed in the order specified.

    -- description: creates users and groups tables
    -- authoredAt: 1469630066000
    -- up:

    -- stage: 1
    CREATE TABLE groups (
      id uuid,
      name text,
      PRIMARY KEY (id)
    )

    -- stage: 2
    CREATE TABLE users (
      id uuid,
      group_id uuid,
      username text,
      password text,
      PRIMARY KEY (id)
    )


    -- down:

    -- stage: 1
    DROP TABLE users

    -- stage: 2
    DROP TABLE groups
    
   
The Pillar command line interface expects to find migrations in conf/pillar/migrations unless overriden by the
-d command-line option.

#### Configuration

Pillar uses the [Typesafe Config][typesafeconfig] library for configuration. The Pillar command-line interface expects
to find an application.conf file in ./conf or ./src/main/resources.
The ReplicationStrategy and ReplicationFactor can be configured via environment. If left out completely,
SimplyStrategy with RF 3 will be used by default.
Given a data store called faker, the application.conf might look like the following:

```
    pillar.faker {
        development {
            cassandra-seed-address: "127.0.0.1"
            cassandra-datacenter-name: "dc1"
            cassandra-keyspace-name: "pillar_development"
            replicationStrategy: "SimpleStrategy"
            replicationFactor: 0
        }
    }
```
```
    pillar.faker {
        development {
            cassandra-seed-address: "127.0.0.1"
            cassandra-datacenter-name: "dc1"
            cassandra-keyspace-name: "pillar_development"
            replicationStrategy: "NetworkTopologyStrategy"
            replicationFactor: [
                {dc1: 2},
                {dc2: 3}
            ]
        }
    }
```

##### SSL & Authentication
You can optionally add ssl options and authentication to each of the environments:

    pillar.faker {
        development {
            cassandra-seed-address: "127.0.0.1"
            cassandra-datacenter-name: "dc1"
            cassandra-keyspace-name: "pillar_development"
            auth {
                username: cassandra
                password: secret
            }
        }
        test {
            auth {
                username: cassandra
                password: secret
            }
            use-ssl: true
            ssl-options: {
                    # ssl with just a trust store for test environment
                    trust-store-path: foobar.jks # maps to javax.net.ssl.trustStore
                    trust-store-password: secret # maps to javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword
                    trust-store-type: JKS        # maps to javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType
                }

            }
        }
        production {
            auth {
                username: cassandra
                password: secret
            }
            use-ssl: true
            ssl-options {
                trust-store-path: foobar.jks # maps to javax.net.ssl.trustStore
                trust-store-password: secret # maps to javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword
                trust-store-type: JKS        # maps to javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType
                key-store-path: keystore.jks # maps to javax.net.ssl.keyStore
                key-store-password: secret   # maps to javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword
                key-store-type: JKS          # maps to javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType
            }

    }

#### The pillar Executable

The package installs to /opt/pillar by default. The /opt/pillar/bin/pillar executable usage looks like this:

    Usage: pillar [OPTIONS] command data-store

    OPTIONS

    -d directory
    --migrations-directory directory  The directory containing migrations

    -e env
    --environment env                 environment

    -t time
    --time-stamp time                 The migration time stamp

    PARAMETERS

    command     migrate or initialize

    data-store  The target data store, as defined in application.conf

#### More Examples

Initialize the faker datastore development environment

    % pillar -e development initialize faker

Apply all migrations to the faker datastore development environment

    % pillar -e development migrate faker

### Library

You can also integrate Pillar directly into your application as a library.
Reference the acceptance spec suite for details.
